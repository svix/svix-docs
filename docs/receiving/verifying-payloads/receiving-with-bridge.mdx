[Svix Bridge] is useful in cases where you want to consume webhooks and write the payloads to a message queue.


## Using the Built-in HTTP Server

Since Bridge can act as an HTTP server, you can configure it as an Endpoint in Svix.
Bridge can even verify webhooks when configured with an `endpoint_secret`.

For example, receiving webhooks from Svix, lightly reshaping the payload, then publishing to RabbitMQ might be
configured like this:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'events-from-acme'
    input:
      type: 'svix-webhook'
      path_id: 'acme'
      endpoint_secret: '${ENDPOINT_SECRET}'

    transformation: |
      function handler(input) {
        let event_type = input.eventType;
        delete input.eventType;
        // The `payload` field is what will be published to the queue.
        return { payload: { event_type, ...input } };
      }

    output:
      type: 'rabbitmq'
      uri: '${RABBITMQ_URI}'
      exchange: ''
      routing_key: 'acme'
```

The `path_id` defined here represents the trailing path segment for the route this receiver will match.
The route for this example would be `/webhook/acme` and sending a `POST` request here with a valid JSON body will result
in a new message published to the `acme` queue.

This is to say, if you're running Bridge at `https://my-bridge.example.com`, the full URL you'd register as a Svix
Endpoint would be `https://my-bridge.example.com/webhook/acme`.
See [Adding Endpoints](../using-app-portal/adding-endpoints.mdx) for more on how to do this in the App Portal.


## Using A Polling Endpoint

Bridge can consume messages sent to [Ingest](/receiving/receiving-with-ingest) or any Svix Application with a
[Polling Endpoint](/advanced-endpoints/polling-endpoints) configured as a destination.

This is a great option if you don't want to run a public-internet-facing HTTP server to receive webhooks.
Since Bridge initiates requests from within your environment, you don't need to open any ports in your firewall!

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: "msg-poller-to-rabbitmq-example"
    input:
      type: "svix-message-poller"
      # The consumer id should be unique per the app & sink.
      # This is used to track Bridge's position in the stream so it can resume where it left off
      # after restarting, etc.
      consumer_id: "my-consumer"
      # The app id, and sink id can be found in the URL for the corresponding Polling Endpoint.
      # Eg:
      # https://api.us.svix.com/api/v1/app/app_2mG6DgUaGlwCNdM5oRCUJec2kQC/poller/poll_59q
      #                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        ^^^^^^^^
      app_id: "app_XXXX"
      sink_id: "poll_XXXX"
      # The token can be seen in the UI for the corresponding Polling Endpoint.
      token: "${POLLING_ENDPOINT_TOKEN}"

    transformation: |
      function handler(input) {
        let event_type = input.eventType;
        delete input.eventType;
        // The `payload` field is what will be published to the queue.
        return { payload: { event_type, ...input } };
      }

    output:
      type: "rabbitmq"
      uri: "${QUEUE_URI}"
      exchange: ""
      routing_key: "my_queue"
```
