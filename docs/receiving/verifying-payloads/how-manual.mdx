The recommended way to verify webhooks is using our official libraries as outlined in the [How to Verify](./how.mdx) section.

However, here are instructions for verifying manually for those who need it.

## Verifying signatures manually

Each webhook call includes three headers with additional information that are used for verification:

* `Svix-Id`: the unique message identifier for the webhook message. This identifier is unique across all messages, but will be the same when the same webhook is being resent (e.g. due to a previous failure).
* `Svix-Timestamp`: timestamp in [seconds since epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
* `Svix-Signature`: the [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded signature.

### Constructing the signed content

The signature is composed by concatenating the following the id, timestamp and payload, separated by the full-stop character `.`. Which in code will look something like:

```javascript
signed_content = "${svix_id}.${svix_timestamp}.${body}"
```

Where `body` is the raw body of the request. The signature is sensitive to any changes, so even a small change in the body will cause the signature to be completely different. This means that you should *not* change the body in any way before verifying.

### Determining the expected signature

Svix uses an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) with [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to sign its webhooks.

So to calculate the expected signature, you should HMAC the `signed_content` from above using your secret webhook signature key. This generated signature should match the one sent in the `Svix-Signature` header.

Please note that to compare the signatures it's recommended to use a constant-time string comparison method in order to prevent timing attacks.

### Verify timestamp

As mentioned above, Svix also sends the timestamp of the attempt in the `Svix-Timestamp` header. You should compare this timestamp against your system timestamp and make sure it's within your tolerance in order to prevent timestamp attacks.
