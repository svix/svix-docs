title: Polling Endpoints
---

Polling Endpoints are a way to get a stream of events by polling, without having to set up a webhook endpoint.

Start by creating an endpoint and select *Polling Endpoint* as the type.

![Polling Endpoint Create](../../img/advanced-endpoints/polling-endpoint-create.png)

As with [regular webhook endpoints](/receiving/using-app-portal/adding-endpoints), you can control which event types and channels you want to receive.


# Usage

Once you've created a Polling Endpoint, you'll get a unique URL like `https://api.us.svix.com/api/v1/app/app_2mG6DgUaGlwCNdM5oRCUJec2kQC/poller/poll_59q`.

You can call this endpoint directly once you have an [API key](/receiving/using-app-portal/polling-endpoints#api-keys).

```bash
curl \
  "https://api.us.svix.com/api/v1/app/app_2mG6DgUaGlwCNdM5oRCUJec2kQC/poller/poll_59q" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_poll_*****.eu'
```

When first calling the endpoint, it will return an empty array and an iterator.

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "iterator": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOi05MjIzMzcyMDM2ODU0Nzc1ODA4LCJhZnRlciI6bnVsbH0",
  "done": false
}
```

Then, using the iterator in the next call, you can iterate through the events and poll for new ones.

```bash
curl \
  -X GET "https://api.us.svix.com/api/v1/app/app_2mG6DgUaGlwCNdM5oRCUJec2kQC/poller/poll_59q?iterator=eyJv..." \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_poll_*****.eu'
```

An example response might look like this:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ev_1234567890",
      "type": "invoice.created",
      "created_at": 1715289600
    },
    {
      "id": "ev_1234567891",
      "type": "invoice.updated",
      "created_at": 1715289601
    }
  ],
  "iterator": "aHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuc3ZpeC5jb20vYXBpL3YxL2FwcC9hcHBfMm1HNkRnVWE=",
  "done": false
}
```

### API Keys

To call the Polling Endpoint, you'll need to create an endpoint-specific API key.


<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'space-between', width: '100%', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
<div style={{ width: '35%' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../img/advanced-endpoints/polling-endpoint-details-create-key.png').default}
    alt="Polling Endpoint Create API Key"
    style={{ objectFit: 'contain', boxShadow: '0 0' }}
  />
</div>
  <div style={{ width: '60%' }}>
  <img
    src={require('../../img/advanced-endpoints/polling-endpoint-create-key.png').default}
    alt="Polling Endpoint Create API Key"
    style={{ objectFit: 'contain', boxShadow: '0 0' }}
  />
  </div>
</div>


API keys are scoped exclusively to the endpoint they were created for, and they can be expired or rotated at any time.
