![unfiltered message logs](/img/app-portal/log-list.png)

If you need to track down a particular message that was sent to one of your
endpoints, there are a few ways to help you find it.

If you know what endpoint it went to, the **endpoint page** has a filtered
list of all messages sent to it. You can filter this list by
**event type**. If you know roughly when the message was sent, you can further
narrow down the list using the **date filter**.

You can choose to filter from one of the presets:

- 5 hours ago
- yesterday
- last week
- last month
- custom

If you choose "custom", you can specify an exact date and time to jump back to
in the message list.
