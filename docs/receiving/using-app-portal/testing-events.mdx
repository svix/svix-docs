title: Testing Events
---

The easiest way to be more confident in your endpoint configuation
is to start receiving events as quickly as possible.

That's why we we have a "Testing" tab for you to send example events
to your endpoint.

After sending an example event, you can click into the message to view
the message payload, all of the message attempts, and whether it
successed or failed.
