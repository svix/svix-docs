The [Svix CLI](https://github.com/svix/svix-cli) is one of the fastest ways to interact with our API.

With the Svix CLI you can:
 - Interact with our API
 - Validate Webhook payloads
 - Quickly open our docs

In this tutorial, we will learn how to install, update, and use the Svix CLI.

### 1) Install the Svix CLI

<CLITabs>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

To install the Svix CLI with [Hombrew](https://homebrew.sh), run:



```sh
brew install svix/svix/svix
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="scoop">

To install the Svix CLI with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), run:


```sh
scoop bucket add svix https://github.com/svix/scoop-svix.git
```

```sh
scoop install svix
```

To install the Svix CLI on macOS without Homebrew:

1. Download the latest Darwin tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`

2. Optionally, install the binary in a location where you can execute it globally (e.g., /usr/local/bin).

<TabItem value="linux">

To install the Svix CLI on Linux without a package manager:

1. Download the latest Linux tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`

3. Run the executable: `./svix`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

To install the Svix CLI on Windows without Scoop:

1. Download the latest Windows tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the `svix_X.X.X_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` file.

3. Run the `.exe` file

</TabItem>
</CLITabs>

### 2) Login to your Svix Account

After installing the Svix CLI, you must pair it with your Svix account.

To do so, run `svix login` in the terminal. You will be prompted for your Svix Auth Token.

Once supplied, this will be stored in your configuration file.

:::info
On most platforms, your config file can be found at `~/.config/svix/config.toml`.

On Windows, your config file can be found at `%APPDATA%/svix/config.toml`
:::

If you would prefer not to store your AUTH_TOKEN on disk you can temporarily set it via the `SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable:

 - On macOS and Linux: `export SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN=<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>`
 - On Windows via command prompt: `set SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN=<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>`
 - On Windows via PowerShell: `$env:SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN = '<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>'`

### 3) Run your first command

Youâ€™re now ready to use the Svix CLI. To get started let's create a new application:

```sh
svix application create --data-name "My Application"
```

This command creates a new application on Svix and returns the raw application object as JSON.

### 4) Upgrade the Svix CLI

<CLITabs>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

To upgrade the Svix CLI with [Hombrew](https://homebrew.sh), run:



```sh
brew upgrade svix/svix/svix
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="scoop">

To upgrade the Svix CLI with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), run:


```sh
scoop update svix
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

To upgrade the Svix CLI on macOS without Homebrew:

1. Download the latest Darwin `tar.gz` file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`

2. Optionally, install the binary in a location where you can execute it globally (e.g., /usr/local/bin).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

To upgrade the Svix CLI on Linux without a package manager:


1. Download the latest Linux `tar.gz` file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`

3. Run the executable: `./svix`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

To upgrade the Svix CLI on Windows without Scoop:

1. Download the latest Windows `tar.gz` file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the `svix_X.X.X_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` file.

3. Run the `.exe` file

</TabItem>
</CLITabs>

### 5) Get creative

The Svix CLI has commands to interact with every part of the Svix API.

To get a complete list of commands, run `svix --help`.

Each command accepts raw JSON input as either the first positional argument or piped in over `stdin`.

With this in mind, you can chain Svix CLI commands together with other command line tools like the popular JSON parser
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to create powerful snippets to improve your workflow.

For example, to automatically open the dashboard for the app we created in step 3, on macOS you can run the following command:


```sh
svix application list |  jq '.data[] | select(.name == "My Application").id' | xargs svix auth dashboard | jq '.url' | xargs open
```

With a slight modification, we can convert this one-liner to a shell function:

```zsh
function dashboard {
   svix application list | jq -r --arg NAME "$1" '.data[] | select(.name == $NAME).id' | xargs svix auth dashboard | jq '.url' | xargs open
}
```

Which you can run like so:

```zsh
dashboard "My Application"
```
