The [Svix CLI](https://github.com/svix/svix-cli) is one of the fastest ways to interact with our API.

With the Svix CLI you can interact with our API, validate webhook payloads, quickly open our docs, and much more.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to install the Svix CLI and use it to send your first webhook message!

### Install the Svix CLI

<CLITabs>
<TabItem value="homebrew">

To install the Svix CLI with [Homebrew](https://homebrew.sh), run:



```sh
brew install svix/svix/svix
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="scoop">

To install the Svix CLI with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), run:


```sh
scoop bucket add svix https://github.com/svix/scoop-svix.git
```

```sh
scoop install svix
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macos">

To install the Svix CLI on macOS without Homebrew:

1. Download the latest Darwin tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz`

2. Optionally, install the binary in a location where you can execute it globally (e.g., /usr/local/bin).

<TabItem value="linux">

To install the Svix CLI on Linux without a package manager:

1. Download the latest Linux tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the file: `tar -xvf svix_X.X.X_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz`

3. Run the executable: `./svix`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

To install the Svix CLI on Windows without Scoop:

1. Download the latest Windows tar.gz file from <https://github.com/svix/svix-cli/releases/latest>

2. Extract the `svix_X.X.X_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` file.

3. Run the `.exe` file

</TabItem>
</CLITabs>

### Pair with your Svix Account

After installing the Svix CLI, you must pair it with your Svix account.

To do so, run `svix login` in the terminal. You will be prompted for your Svix Auth Token.

Once supplied, it will be stored in your configuration file.

If you prefer not to store your Auth Token on disk you can temporarily set it via the `SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable:

 - On macOS and Linux: `export SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN=<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>`
 - On Windows via command prompt: `set SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN=<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>`
 - On Windows via PowerShell: `$env:SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN = '<MY-AUTH-TOKEN>'`

### Create an application

Youâ€™re now ready to use the Svix CLI. To get started let's create a new application:

```sh
svix application create --data-name "My Application"
```

This command creates a new application on Svix and returns the raw application object as JSON.

## List your applications

Now that we've created an app we can list our existing apps with the following command:

```sh
svix application list
```

The list command by default returns the first 50 applications, you can change this limit by adding the `--limit` flag

```sh
svix application list --limit 100 # get the first 100 applications
```

### Add an endpoint

Next let's add an endpoint to the application we created above.  The create command should have returned an Application ID.
Since the application name is not unique, will need its ID to make changes.

Let's add a webhook endpoint with the url `http://example.com/webhook`. Every endpoint must have a version associated with it
to help you version your webhook API.  For this example we will set the version to `1`.

```sh
svix endpoint create <MY-APP-ID> --data-url http://example.com/webhook --data-version 1
```

## Send a message

Now that we have an application created and an endpoint configured to listen to messages from that app, we are ready to send our first
webhook message! Let's send a `user.created` event with the users name and email.

```sh
svix message create <MY-APP-ID> --data-eventType "user.created" --data-payload "{\"username\":\"new_user\",\"email\":\"new_user@example.com\"}"
```

This message will now be sent to Svix and dispatched to all webhook endpoints listening to your application.

### Get creative

The Svix CLI has commands to interact with every part of the Svix API.

To get a complete list of commands, run `svix --help`.

Each command accepts raw JSON input as either the first positional argument or piped in over `stdin`.

With this in mind, you can chain Svix CLI commands together with other command line tools like the popular JSON parser
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to create powerful snippets to improve your workflow.

For example, to automatically open the dashboard for the app we created in step 3, on macOS you can run the following command:


```sh
svix application get <MY-APP-ID> | jq '.id' | xargs svix auth dashboard | jq '.url' | xargs open
```

With a slight modification, we can convert this one-liner to a shell function:

```zsh
function dashboard {
   svix application get "$1" | jq '.id' | xargs svix auth dashboard | jq '.url' | xargs open
}
```

Which you can run like so:

```zsh
dashboard <MY-APP-ID>
```
