Diahook comes with a management UI for your users that you can use out of the box. Your users can then use it to add endpoints, debug delivery, as well as inspect and replay past webhooks. This is the easiest way to get started, but you can alternatively use the API to build your own.

Here is how it looks like:

## Giving your users access

To give your users access to the admin UI, just use the [dashboard access endpoint](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/authentication/get_dashboard_access_api_v1_auth_dashboard_access__app_id___post). Calling this endpoint with an `app_id`, returns a url you can just redirect your users to in order to log them into the admin UI. They will stay logged in for a few days or until they log out.
