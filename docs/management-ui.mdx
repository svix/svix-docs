Svix comes with a management UI for your users that you can use out of the box. Your users can then use it to add endpoints, debug delivery, as well as inspect and replay past webhooks. This is the easiest way to get started, but you can alternatively use the API to build your own.

Here is how it looks like:

## Giving your users access

To give your users access to the admin UI, just use the [dashboard access endpoint](https://api.svix.com/docs#/authentication/get_dashboard_access_api_v1_auth_dashboard_access__app_id___post). Calling this endpoint with an `app_id`, returns a url you can just redirect your users to in order to log them into the admin UI. They will stay logged in for a few days or until they log out.

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const svix = new Svix("AUTH_TOKEN");
const dashboard = await svix.authentication.dashboardAccess("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0");
// A URL that automatically logs user into the dashboard
console.log(dashboard.url);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
svix = Svix("AUTH_TOKEN")
dashboard = svix.authentication.dashboardAccess("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0")
# A URL that automatically logs user into the dashboard
print(dashboard.url)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="go">

```go
svixClient := svix.New("AUTH_TOKEN", nil)
dashboard, _ := svixClient.Authentication.DashboardAccess("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0")
// A URL that automatically logs user into the dashboard
fmt.Println(dashboard.Url)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">

```shell
export SVIX_AUTH_TOKEN="AUTH_TOKEN"
svix authentication dashboard app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.svix.com/api/v1/auth/dashboard_access/app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization:  Bearer AUTH_TOKEN"
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


## Embedding in your own dashboard

The returned URL from the previous section can also be embedded in your own dashboard using an iframe.

<img alt="Embedded Management UI screenshot" src={useBaseUrl("img/embedded-management-ui.png")} />

To add this to your application, just pass the URL you received in the previous example to the `src` property of the iframe:

```html
<iframe
    src="http://localhost:3000/login#key=eyJhcHBJZCI6ICJhcHBfMXRSdFlMN3pwWWR2NHFuWTRRZFI1azE4eXQ0IiwgInRva2VuIjogImFwcHNrX2UxOUN0Rm5hbTFoOU1Gamh5azRSMTUzNUNSd05VSWI0In0="
>
</iframe>
```

Or with some basic styling to make it look better:

```html
<iframe
    src="http://localhost:3000/login#key=eyJhcHBJZCI6ICJhcHBfMXRSdFlMN3pwWWR2NHFuWTRRZFI1azE4eXQ0IiwgInRva2VuIjogImFwcHNrX2UxOUN0Rm5hbTFoOU1Gamh5azRSMTUzNUNSd05VSWI0In0="
    style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"
>
</iframe>
```

## White labeling

Keep the same look and feel of your application by white labeling the Management UI. From the [Svix dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com/settings), you can configure the color palette as well as the logo that your users will see.

To customize these settings please head to [the dashboard](https://dashboard.svix.com) and change it under "Settings".
