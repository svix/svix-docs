As you may expect from a webhooks service, Svix also uses webhooks to notify you of events. To configure which event types you would like to listen to and which endpoints these events will be sent to, please use the [Operational Webhooks](https://dashboard.svix.com/webhooks) section of the dashboard.


## Messages we send

The type of messages we send, their schemas, and related documentation are all available in [the webhook section](https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Webhooks) of the API reference documentation.
