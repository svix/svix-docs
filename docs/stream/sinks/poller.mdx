# Polling Endpoints

Unlike other Sinks, Polling endpoints allow you to build clients to fetch events from the Stream directly, rather than having events pushed to you by Svix.

Like all Sinks, Polling Endpoint can be created in the Stream Portal or [in the API](https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Sink/operation/v1.stream.sink.create).

```shell
curl -X 'POST' 'https://api.svix.com/api/v1/stream/strm_30XKA2tCdjHue2qLkTgc0/sink' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "type": "poller",
  "uid": "unique-identifier",
  "status": "enabled",
  "eventTypes": [],
  "metadata": {}
}'
```

As with other Sinks, you can specify which `eventTypes` you want the Sink to filter events on.

Unlike with other Sinks, the `batchSize`, `maxWaitSecs`, and transformations are ignored, as these settings aren't relevant for Polling endpoints.

## Usage
In the Stream Portal, event consumers will get a unique URL and an API key to iterate through the full list of events sent to their Svix Stream since the endpoint was created.

When creating a Polling Endpoint, consumers will get a unique URL like `https://api.svix.com/api/v1/stream/{stream_id}/sink/{sink_id}/events`

When first calling the endpoint, it will return an empty array and an iterator.

```json
{
  "data": [],
  "iterator": "eyJvZmZzZXQiOi05MjIzMzcyMDM2ODU0Nzc1ODA4LCJhZnRlciI6bnVsbH0",
  "done": false
}
```

Then, using the iterator in the next call, they can iterate through the events and poll for new ones.

```bash
curl \
  "https://api.svix.com/api/v1/stream/strm_30Vcjgt1o7mvmPbnhOQAB/sink/sink_30kXEU88euaFZlU1P5W0B?iterator=eyJv..." \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer sk_poll_*****.eu'
```

Events will be returned in the order they were posted to the Stream.
