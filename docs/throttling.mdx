<HeaderWithCopyButton title="Endpoint Throttling" sourceMarkdown={RAW} />

While Svix can handle however many messages you send us, your customers' endpoints may not be able to. This is why the Svix API includes throttling of calls to customer endpoints.

This lets you send as many webhooks per second as you want without having to worry about overloading your customers' systems.


## How does it work?

You can set a throttling rate on both the application, which applies to all of the endpoints for that application, or the endpoint itself to only set it for that specific endpoint.

The throttling rate is defined as a limit for the number of messages per second to send to the endpoint. After the limit is reached, requests will get throttled so to keep a consistent rate under the limit.

Due to the nature of distributed systems the actual rate of messages can sometimes be slightly above the enforced throttling rate. So for example, if you set a throttling rate of 1,000 per seconds, an endpoint may potentially get messages at a rate of 1,050 or even higher.


## Setting the limits

You can set the throttling rate on either the application or each of its endpoint. The throttling rate is enforced per endpoint, so limits set on the application propagate to the endpoints and can be overridden by the endpoint specific settings.

### Setting application throttling rates

You can set the throttling rate on an application when [creating](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/create_application_api_v1_app__post) or [updating](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/update_application_api_v1_app__app_id___put) it using the `throttleRate` property. The value is the number of messages per second.

### Setting endpoint throttling rates

Similar to the application throttling rate, you can set the throttling rate on an endpoint when [creating](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/create_endpoint_api_v1_app__app_id__endpoint__post) or [updating](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/update_endpoint_api_v1_app__app_id__endpoint__endpoint_id___put) it using the `throttleRate` property. The value is the number of messages per second.


## Intended use

The throttling rate is intended to be used as a sort of a fuse to protect your customers' servers from sudden peaks in message traffic that they may not be able to withstand. With the limit, this peak is smoothened and spread over multiple seconds, sending messages at a rate your customers can handle.

One important thing to remember with throttling, is that if you are limiting to 1,000 messages per second and are consistently sending messages over that limit (e.g. 2,000 per second), the queue will get congested and you will be sending messages with infinitely increasing delays. We can alert you of such issues, and help you address them when they occur, though this is still something to be mindful of.
