Svix offers a REST API to interact with the service, and easy to use libraries to interact with the API.

Svix also has an API reference and OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications at the [API documentation page](https://api.svix.com/docs) which you can always refer to the exact schemas and endpoints available in our API.
