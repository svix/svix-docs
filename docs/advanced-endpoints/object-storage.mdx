# Object Storage Endpoints

Svix supports sending messages directly to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) and [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs).

This is useful for storing payloads in a cloud storage bucket without your customers having to set up any listener endpoint or write any glue code.

When **Advanced Endpoint Types** is [enabled](/advanced-endpoints/intro#enabling-advanced-endpoint-types), your customers will see the option to use object storage destinations in the [App Portal](/app-portal).

They will be able to configure the connection right in the App Portal.
